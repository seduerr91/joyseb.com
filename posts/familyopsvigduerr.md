### Year 2021

#### Turkey: Sep 7 → Sep 28

Joy and Seb met moving into an AirBnB together on September 7 until September 28 in Istanbul, Turkey. Sharon Rosenberg (American) and Michael Carr (American) invited Joy and Sebastian respectively to spend the time with them. While everybody of the four of them was a member of the WifiTribe, a digital nomad community with 800 members, it was only then that Joy and Seb met for the first time in person.

#### Mexico: Nov 3 → Nov 23

Joy was scheduled to fly to Mexico with Mike and Sharon for dia de los muertos. Seb wanted to join her for that day but there was hardly any availability to fly from Europe to Mexico for that special event. Hence, Seb flew one week later and met Joy in Ciudad de Mexico having his first apartment only with Joy, and later one with Joy and Sharon.

#### Austria: Mar 15 → May 07 [AirBnB + Silvio]

Next Sebastian brought Joy to his previous home of Vienna, Austria. They flew together, and stayed for 7 weeks in the world's most livable city. Three trips from Vienna brought them to Croatia, Slovakia and for Joy's 30th birthday to Brno, Czechia. Seb introduced Joy to his friends and they stayed a few nights at Silvio's place first, before getting their own AirBnB. The first half we stayed at Silvio's in Seb's former flat share. Please find a receipt for the second half and the flight ticket below.

#### Germany: May 07 → May 12 [Seb's parents]

Before Joy flew back to the United States we traveled to Germany so that Joy could meet Seb's family, nieces, and everyone for 5 days (we couldn't visit earlier as Seb's parents were reconstructing the entire house, and it wasn't visitable for us). The following picture depicts Burkard and Andrea Duerr (Seb's parents), Joy & Seb in front of the fortress of Wuerzburg. We enjoyed a glass of wine after a city tour on that bridge. Wuerzburg is Seb's closest town to home, and he went to school there for many years.

Then, we had to separate for our longest period, since Joy had to leave Schengen and Seb had to stay for a business meeting on June 2, 2022 in Bamberg, Germany. Therefore, he flew to the US as soon as possible to reunite with his love.

#### United States: June 3

Although Seb’s family couldn’t attend in person, they zoomed in for the event. From left to right: his father, Burkard, mother, Andrea, brother-in-law, Alex, and his sister Sabrina. Although it was 1:30 am their time in Germany, they really wanted to be a part of the special event. We are so incredibly happy they were able to attend virtually with us.
